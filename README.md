# 2-Factor-Authentication
A simple and responsive 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) system built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This project demonstrates the core concept of enhancing login security using a verification code sent to the user (simulated in this case).

ðŸ§© Features
âœ… Step 1 â€“ User Login
A basic login form where the user enters their username and password.

âœ… Step 2 â€“ Verification Code
After successful login, a 6-digit verification code is "sent" (simulated) and the user must enter it correctly to complete authentication.

âœ… Input Validation
Handles incorrect logins or verification codes with error messages.

âœ… Code Expiry Timer
Adds a countdown for code validity (e.g., 60 seconds) to simulate real 2FA systems.

âœ… Responsive UI
Fully responsive, clean, and modern interface built with HTML & CSS.

ðŸŽ¯ Technologies Used
HTML5 â€“ Structure and layout

CSS3 â€“ Styling and transitions

JavaScript (ES6) â€“ Logic, input validation, and 2FA simulation
